            <li>2 tbsp Olive Oil</li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the rice</h3>
            <li>3 cups Basmati Rice</li>
            <li>3 Bay Leaves</li>
            <li>2 tsp Spice Mix (From The Spice Blend)</li>
            <li>½ tsp Turmeric Powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp Saffron Strands</li>
            <li>3 Dried Limes</li>
            <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>4.5 cups Water & Broth</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the garnish</h3>
            <li>4 small Onions</li>
            <li>1 cup Oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup Almonds</li>
            <li>¼ cup Raisins</li>
            <li>1 tsp Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>For the spice blend</h3>
            <li>Start by placing all of the spices for the blend except for the turmeric in a small skillet and toast on
                medium heat for 1-2 minutes, moving them around constantly. Be careful as they burn fast! Remove them as
                soon as they start to become really fragrant.</li>
            <li>Once toasted, remove and place in a spice or coffee grinder and grind until a fine powder forms.</li>
            <li>Remove 2 teaspoons from the spice mix and set aside for the rice. Add the turmeric to the remainder of
                the
                spice mix and set aside to be used for the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To marinate the chicken</h3>
            <li>To the spice blend, add the ½ teaspoon turmeric and the 1.5 teaspoons salt listed under the chicken.
            </li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the spice mix and create a paste. Lather the paste onto the chicken
                legs and massage it in really well.</li>
            <li>Place the marinated chicken in an airtight container and marinate overnight in the fridge for optimal
                results. If you can't do this, you can marinate for 30 mins to 1 hour to save time.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To fry the onions</h3>
            <li>Thinly slice all of the onions evenly. I do this by hand but if you want to be precise you can always
                use a
                cutter (even size helps them fry evenly).</li>
            <li>Add the one cup of vegetable oil to the pot (the same pot you will cook rice in) and heat on medium
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the onions in and fry them, stirring them every 3-4 minutes. This process will take 10-15 minutes,
                so be
                patient! But also be careful, towards the end, they will burn fast so keep a watchful eye and remove
                them
                quickly.</li>
            <li>Remove the onions when they look golden brown, leaving approximately 3 tablespoons of onions in the pot
                for
                the rice. Spread on a paper towel lined plate to absorb the oil. As they cool they will crisp up . Set
                aside
                until ready to garnish.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To cook the chicken</h3>
            <li>The chicken will cook by steaming. Start this process after marinating the chicken. To the pot that you
                fried the onions in (and with the remaining onions and oil inside), add the spice mix that was set aside
                for
                the rice.</li>
            <li>Carefully pierce the dry limes a couple of times using a sharp knife (be careful because they are
                round!)
                and add them to the pot along with the bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Cook the spices in the oil on medium heat for a few minutes. Add 2 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Place a steaming rack in the pot (if you don't have a steaming rack, use a small wire rack similar to an
                instant pot insert). Place the marinated chicken on the steaming rack.</li>
            <li>Close the pot lid and steam the chicken for 50 minutes on medium heat. Check it every 10 minutes to
                ensure
                there is enough water and top it up if not.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken (reserve the broth) when cooked through and place on an oven baking tray (preferably
                on
                an over wire rack placed on top of a tray, but you can use a tray too).</li>
            <li>Brush the top with the remaining olive oil and bake for 20 mins at 400F. Broil the top for 5 minutes
                until
                golden brown. Remove and keep warm.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>To make the rice</h3>
            <li>Wash the rice really well multiple times until the water runs clear, then soak for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a mortar and pestle, grind the saffron to a fine powder then add 2 tablespoons of hot water (boiled
                water
                that has cooled slightly) and bloom for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Strain the broth that was used to steam the chicken. Using a measuring cup, measure out how much broth
                you
                have and add to it some water (if required) to get exactly 4.5 cups of liquid.</li>
            <li>Pour the liquid back into the same pot. Add to it the turmeric listed under rice, the salt and the
                bloomed
                saffron. Taste and ensure it is visibly salty (like sea water). Allow it to come to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the rice to the broth and stir a few times to combine. Allow it to come to a boil uncovered for a
                few
                minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once bubbling, place a paper towel on top of the pot and then close the lid. Lower the heat to medium
                low
                and allow it to cook for 20 minutes, undisturbed.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and fluff with a fork. Close the lid and allow it to stand for 10
                minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>For the garnish</h3>
            <li>The first layer of garnish will be the fried onions.</li>
            <li>To prepare the almonds, cook them on medium heat with the olive oil until golden. Stir continuously.
                Remove
                and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the raisins in and toast for 2 minutes. Combine with the almonds.</li>
        </ol>
